        reports of situations in which children age 17 or under may be in jeopardy
        because of abuse, abandonment, sexual molestation, exploitation or neglect.
        When the home situation is such that the child needs to be placed under the
        protection of the juvenile court, this unit initiates court action, conducts
        an investigation and supervises children who have been removed from parental
        custody. Can make immediate placements in emergency shelter care when children
        are endangered. May also aid children by providing casework and related services
        to their families, and making referrals to appropriate agencies.                  A
        report may be made in person, by phone or letter and may be anonymous, though
        all names are held confidential. Anyone initiating a referral in good faith
        is immune from liability. Provides information and refers within the agency
        for all specialized children''s services. Counseling, support groups and in-home
        services can be provided to families receiving protective services supervision
        from this agency. Provides shelter care for children, age 18 or under, who
        need to be removed from their own homes because they are in danger due to
        neglect, abuse, abandonment, exploitation or other family crisis. Young children
        are placed in temporary foster homes. Adolescents are placed in the central
        receiving home. All requests for emergency care or removal of a child from
        a home in crisis must be made through the Hotline or the local police department.
        The county is a state-licensed adoption and foster home licensing agency providing
        services to birth parents, pre-adoptive children, adoptive and foster parent
        applicants. Provides information about adoption procedures to birth parents.
        Children are generally of school age, of minority or mixed background or have
        special problems. Written application, office and home interviews are necessary.
        Provides post-adoption services to assist adoptees, birth parents or adoptive
        parents. Provides relinquishment adoption services. Does not provide intercountry
        adoption services. Helps to arrange for out-of-home placement of children,
        age 17 or under, in group homes or institutions. Families must meet certain
        criteria in order for the children to be considered for placement. This unit
        cannot handle the placement of delinquents or children beyond parental control.
        This office also licenses foster family homes throughout the county as required
        by law for care on a regular basis of a non-related child age 17 or under.
        Homes are licensed for one year and renewed annually. Will investigate complaints
        or reports of persons caring for non-related children without a license or
        of licensed persons giving improper care. The Foster Care Eligibility line
        handles questions related to payments to foster parents, non-related guardians,
        and relatives. Speakers are available for clubs or groups who wish to know
        more about foster care, \"fostadopt\" and adoptions. For matters other than
        court investigations, licensing, shelter care or adoptions, please contact

        programs.   Adult Protective Services is a function of Centralized Intake.
        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public
        health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments
        of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access
        and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of
        the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response
        Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses
        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned

        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,

        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding
        for a variety of programs, advocates on behalf of older persons and provides
        long-range planning, coordination, and program development for programs and
        services for older adults. The New Beginning Coalition (650-573-3527) is a
        broad-based group of providers and consumers that works in partnership with
        Aging and Adult Services and other organizations to improve the quality of
        life of older persons and adults with disabilities. Other programs include
        the Commission on Aging and the Commission on Disabilities (described separately).","emails":["lmancini@smcgov.org"],"faxes":["650
